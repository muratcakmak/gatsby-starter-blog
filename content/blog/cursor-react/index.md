## 🔍 Cursor Rules for React Developers

### 1. **Understanding Rule Types and Scopes**

Cursor supports three primary types of rules:([Cursor][1])

* **Global Rules**: Set in `Settings > General > Rules for AI`, these apply across all projects.([Reddit][2])

* **Project Rules**: Stored in `.cursor/rules/` within your project, these are version-controlled and scoped to your codebase.([Cursor][1])

* **Folder-Level Rules**: By placing `.cursor/rules/` directories within specific folders (e.g., `frontend/`, `backend/`), you can define rules that apply only to those parts of your project.

This hierarchical structuring allows for granular control over AI behavior, ensuring that suggestions are contextually relevant. ([Cursor][1])

### 2. **Crafting Effective `.mdc` Rule Files**

Each rule is written in Markdown with frontmatter metadata. Here's an example tailored for a React project:([Cursor][1])

```mdc
---
description: React Component Standards
globs: ["**/*.tsx", "**/*.ts"]
alwaysApply: true
---

- Use functional components with TypeScript interfaces.
- Name components using PascalCase.
- Utilize Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Implement custom hooks for reusable logic.
- Avoid using `any` type; prefer explicit typings.
```



This rule ensures that the AI generates code adhering to your React project's conventions.

### 3. **Utilizing Rule Types for Contextual Relevance**

Cursor allows you to specify how and when rules are applied:

* **Always**: Included in every AI interaction.([Medium][3])

* **Auto-Attached**: Applied when files matching specified glob patterns are involved.([Cursor][1])

* **Agent-Requested**: Available for the AI to include as needed, based on its assessment.([Cursor][1])

* **Manual**: Included only when explicitly invoked using `@ruleName`.([Cursor][1])

This flexibility ensures that the AI's behavior aligns with the specific context of your development tasks.&#x20;

## 🏗️ Structuring Your Project for Optimal AI Assistance

For larger projects or monorepos, organizing your rules can enhance maintainability and clarity:

```
project-root/
├── .cursor/
│   └── rules/
│       └── global-rules.mdc
├── frontend/
│   └── .cursor/
│       └── rules/
│           └── frontend-rules.mdc
├── backend/
│   └── .cursor/
│       └── rules/
│           └── backend-rules.mdc
```



This structure allows you to define rules that apply globally, as well as rules specific to the frontend or backend parts of your application.

## 🧠 Enhancing AI Context with Notepads and External Docs

### 1. **Notepads for Reusable Context**

Notepads are shareable documents within Cursor where you can store project context, guidelines, or code snippets. Reference them in chats using `@notepad-name`.([Builder.io][4])

### 2. **Integrating External Documentation**

Incorporate external documentation into the AI's context by adding URLs in `Settings > Features > Docs`. Reference them in chats using `@docs`.

---

## ⚙️ Leveraging Advanced Cursor Features

### 1. **YOLO Mode**

Enable YOLO mode in settings to allow the AI to run commands like tests or builds automatically. This is particularly useful for test-driven development workflows.

### 2. **@web Feature**

Enable real-time web searches within Cursor by activating the `Web Search Tool` in `Settings > Features > Chat`. Use `@web` followed by your query in chats.
