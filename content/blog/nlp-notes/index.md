# Definitions

## SVM (Support Vector Machine)

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a discriminative classifier formally defined by a separating hyperplane. In other words, given labeled training data (supervised learning), the algorithm outputs an optimal hyperplane which categorizes new examples. In two dimentional space this hyperplane is a line dividing a plane in two parts where in each class lay in either side.

### Kernel

### Regularization

The Regularization parameter (often termed as C parameter in pythonâ€™s sklearn library) tells the SVM optimization how much you want to avoid misclassifying each training example.
